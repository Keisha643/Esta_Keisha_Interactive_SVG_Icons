# Esta_Keisha_Interactive_SVG_Icons
This is HW #1 for Multimedia Authoring 2 Class. I am building a branded, scalable themed icon (6 icons) set using Adobe Illustrator. Each icon exported from Illustrator as an SVG. SVGs as assets on the FIP/Brand Revival site (think icons for different flavours or ingredients). Add some simple interactivity with CSS and JavaScript.
